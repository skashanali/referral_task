Problem Statement:
1. Design a Sign Up and Login Management System using Node, Express, and Angular. 
2. The system should have the ability to use referral code which should be saved in a separate collection in the database.
3. For every user signing up, a referral code should be generated and saved in the collection.
4. For every sign up using that referral code, the array of users for the particular record of referral code should be updated with the user id. 
5. Design a sign up and sign in page on the front end and a simple home page with a logout button and functionality.
